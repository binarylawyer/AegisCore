# AegisCore
Aegis Core is the institutional operating system designed to solve the global art market’s critical paradox: the conflict between high-net-worth collector privacy and stringent financial regulation. By pioneering a proprietary "Double-Blind" compliance architecture, Aegis Core separates identity verification from market participation.

Trusted law firms utilize our Opus-powered compliance engine to verify clients off-chain, issuing anonymous, non-falsifiable ERC-3643 attestations on-chain. This allows verified collectors to trade fractionalized, high-value art assets—legally wrapped in Delaware Series LLCs or Luxembourg Compartments—with absolute anonymity, while providing sellers with cryptographic proof of eligibility.

Beyond compliance, Aegis Core unlocks liquidity through the "Profiler," a lead-generation tool powered by Google Vertex AI and Qdrant that discovers collectors from public data without exposing private users. With features like atomic settlement for instant payments and enforced secondary-market royalties, Aegis Core transforms art from an opaque collectible into a liquid, trusted, and legally compliant global asset class.
