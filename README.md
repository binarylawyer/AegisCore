# AegisCore
Aegis Core is the institutional operating system designed to solve the global art market’s critical paradox: the conflict between high-net-worth collector privacy and stringent financial regulation. By pioneering a proprietary "Double-Blind" compliance architecture, Aegis Core separates identity verification from market participation.

Trusted law firms utilize our Opus-powered compliance engine to verify clients off-chain, issuing anonymous, non-falsifiable ERC-3643 attestations on-chain. This allows verified collectors to trade fractionalized, high-value art assets—legally wrapped in Delaware Series LLCs or Luxembourg Compartments—with absolute anonymity, while providing sellers with cryptographic proof of eligibility.

Aegis Core is the institutional operating system for the global art market, solving the critical paradox between collector privacy and regulatory transparency.

Using a proprietary "Double-Blind" architecture, we separate identity verification from market participation. Law firms use our Opus compliance engine to verify clients off-chain, issuing anonymous ERC-3643 attestations on-chain. This allows collectors to trade fractionalized, physical art assets (held in Delaware Series LLCs) with total anonymity, while providing galleries absolute proof of compliance.

Featuring AI-driven discovery via Google Vertex AI and instant atomic settlements, Aegis Core transforms art into a liquid, trusted, and compliant global asset class.
Beyond compliance, Aegis Core unlocks liquidity through the "Profiler," a lead-generation tool powered by Google Vertex AI and Qdrant that discovers collectors from public data without exposing private users. With features like atomic settlement for instant payments and enforced secondary-market royalties, Aegis Core transforms art from an opaque collectible into a liquid, trusted, and legally compliant global asset class.
